# Cloud Computing, in 300 words or less
There are a few things that I like about [my job](https://www.realself.com/about/jobs). One of them is that [we](https://instagr.am/realselflife) are willing to take some managed risks. Another is that we are happy and willing to learn from failure.

One of the changes that we went through over 2017 and 2017 was getting *very* familiar with [#serverless](/tags/serverless/). For those of you that aren't in the Cloud Computing Business, #serverless is this **terrible** word that we're using to describe a computing model where an *event* ( like a web request ) triggers *an execution* ( aka causes some code to run ). Relatively boring stuff, and to the uninitiated, it may seem very much like the way computer ðŸ’© has always worked. There are two major differences, though. First: **you only pay for what you use.** Second: **you explicitly offload transportation concerns to your cloud, and you only handle "business logic".**

\#serverless is the first truly Cloud Native implementation for computing. For most of every moment in history, you had to pay for the privilege of having a computer sitting by, _idle_. The computer would just wait to receive traffic from users ( commonly called `heating air`). Once that traffic was received, we'd execute some code. There's usually _also_ code surrounding the code that you want to execute to handle your user's intent. Code that must be patched on a regular basis. **In #serverless, you mananage _NONE_ of that surrounding layer. No Operating Systems, No Webservers, No Message Busses. Only the code that handles your _already deserialized_ user request.**

Is this #serverless thing really big deal, you ask? **YES.**

Are there really servers in #serverless? **Yes, and it doesn't matter**

# So, I wrote an [ignite](http://www.ignitetalks.io/) talk.
I wrote this talk because of all of the following:

* I think **[our story](https://instagr.am/realselflife)** is one that other people can at least relate to, possibly learn from.
* I'm excited about what #serverless represents for **[Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development)** & **[Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_operator)**
* Public speaking is a personal goal I'm persuing to work on my **[Communication Skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication)**

## our story
[realself](https://www.realself.com) builds a product where human beings share stories of, and seek trusted informtion about, their personal journeys of transformation. It's a big deal for our users, who are engaged in these life changing journeys, and it's a big deal for us to be entrusted with those stories.

When I was interviewing at realself, one moment really stood out for me. It was my first indication that realself was doing things differently from other places that I had worked. A dramatic recreation follows. 

>VP of Engineering> **\(describes a world where developers don't need to understand anything about operations\)** what do you think about that vision? 

>Me> **\(uncomfortable laughter\)** oh boy, I've heard that one before. I've built some opinions on it that you may not care to hear.

>VP of Engineering> Tell me more, we hire people for their opinions

The VP of Engineering had been shooting me straight. I do have [agency](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agency) in my capacity as a team member at realself. ( We're almost always [hiring](https://www.realself.com/about/jobs), if you're looking and into that sort of thing. ) We've built a variety of different types of systems



## Changes for Development & Operations

## Personal Changes


Historically, our major knob for controlling utilization has been [AutoScaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/). Autoscaling is when you adjust your computing capacity up or down based on some metric ( like number of requests ). Autoscaling is sort of like a road that gets wider as more cars traverse it. There's all kinds of disclaimers and caveats to using it, including some **occasionally harrowing** relationships to how automotive traffic works in [the real world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand#Elasticity_of_transport_demand).



1. Cloud libraries are a first class citizen
1. Execution time is limited
1. There's an `at least once` invocation semantic, which is in itself a big change
